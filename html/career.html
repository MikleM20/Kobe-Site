                Kobe Bryant was a once in a generation NBA player, he was often compared to
                Michael Jordan who is often called the greatest of all time, as his game often
                mirrored Michael's. Although many people agree that Michael was greater than Kobe,
                many often say that Kobe is "the most skilled player", as he had a wide variation
                of how he could play and seemed to be able to do it all.
