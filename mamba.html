				<h1>How Does It Relate To Kobe?</h1>
				Kobe gave himself the nickname of "Black Mamba"  as a way to deal with hardships
				he was facing at the time. He used it as another personality, "Kobe" would handle
				personal challenges and "The Black Mamba" would handle things on the basketball court.

				<br><br>

				The nickname ultimately stuck as the name accurately described his on the court
				playstyle and his mindset, often referred to as the "mamba mentality". The idea
				of always giving it your all, having the competitive drive to motivate you to always
				improve oneself and put in the work needed to achieve your goals so when the time comes
				you can trust on the work you've put in and take advantage of the opportunity in front of you.
				The mentality of consistent work and pushing through boundaries and playing through injury and
				never giving up, never falling, just continuing to push through.
